A React-Native utility belt for scaling the size of your apps UI across different sized devices.

## Installation
```js
npm install --save react-native-size-matters
//or:
yarn add react-native-size-matters
```

## Motivation
When developing with react-native, you need to manually adjust your app to look great on a variety of different screen sizes. That's a tedious job.  
react-native-size-matters provides some simple tooling to make your scaling a whole lot easier.  
The idea is to develop once on a standard ~5" screen mobile device and then simply apply the provided utils.  
üìñ You can read more about what led to this library on my blog post, which can be found in [this repo](./examples/BlogPost) or at [Medium](https://medium.com/soluto-engineering/size-matters-5aeeb462900a).

## Api
### Scaling Functions
```js
import { scale, verticalScale, moderateScale } from 'react-native-size-matters';

const Component = props =>
    <View style={{
        width: scale(30),
        height: verticalScale(50),
        padding: moderateScale(5)
    }}/>;
```


* `scale(size: number)`  
Will return a linear scaled result of the provided size, based on your device's screen width.
* `verticalScale(size: number)`  
Will return a linear scaled result of the provided size, based on your device's screen height.

* `moderateScale(size: number, factor?: number)`  
Sometimes you don't want to scale everything in a linear manner, that's where moderateScale comes in.  
The cool thing about it is that you can control the resize factor (default is 0.5).  
If normal scale will increase your size by +2X, moderateScale will only increase it by +X, for example:  
‚û°Ô∏è scale(10) = 20  
‚û°Ô∏è moderateScale(10) = 15  
‚û°Ô∏è moderateScale(10, 0.1) = 11  

All scale functions can be imported using their shorthand alias as well:
```js
import { s, vs, ms } from 'react-native-size-matters';
```


### ScaledSheet
```js
import { ScaledSheet } from 'react-native-size-matters';

const styles = ScaledSheet.create(stylesObject)
```

ScaleSheet will take the same stylesObject a regular StyleSheet will take, plus a special (optional) annotation that will automatically apply the scale functions for you:
* `<size>@s` - will apply `scale` function on `size`.
* `<size>@vs` - will apply `verticalScale` function on `size`.
* `<size>@ms` - will apply `moderateScale` function with resize factor of 0.5 on `size`.
* `<size>@ms<factor>` - will apply `moderateScale` function with resize factor of `factor` on size.

ScaledSheet also supports rounding the result, simply add `r` at the end of the annotation. 

Example:
```js
import { ScaledSheet } from 'react-native-size-matters';

const styles = ScaledSheet.create({
    container: {
        width: '100@s', // = scale(100)
        height: '200@vs', // = verticalScale(200)
        padding: '2@msr', // = Math.round(moderateScale(2))
        margin: 5
    },
    row: {
        padding: '10@ms0.3', // = moderateScale(10, 0.3)
        height: '50@ms' // = moderateScale(50)
    }
});
```

## Changing the Default Guideline Sizes

In the ever-changing mobile devices world, screen sizes change a lot.  
This lib uses 350dp x 680dp as guideline sizes, but if you (or your designer) prefer using different sizes it's possible.

Also, you can disable scaling utility based on device type and orientation. Possible options: 

`PHONE`, `PHONE_PORTRAIT`, `PHONE_LANDSCAPE`, `TABLET`, `TABLET_PORTRAIT`, `TABLET_LANDSCAPE`, `PORTRAIT`, and `LANDSCAPE`.

To do so, first, you'd need to setup [react-native-dotenv](https://github.com/zetachang/react-native-dotenv).  
After setting it up and creating `.env` file, add the following env params to it:
```env
SIZE_MATTERS_BASE_WIDTH=<custom-width>
SIZE_MATTERS_BASE_HEIGHT=<custom-height>
SIZE_MATTERS_DISABLED_DEVICES=<device-types-list> # i.e. PHONE_PORTRAIT|TABLET_LANDSCAPE
```
Next and final step, you should change all your imports to `react-native-size-matters/extend`, for instance:
```javascript
import { ScaledSheet, moderateScale } from 'react-native-size-matters/extend';
```

## Examples
You can clone the [expo-example-app](./examples/expo-example-app) from this repo, run `npm install` and `npm start` and scan the presented QR code in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your preferred device.  
The app has an on/off switch for using `react-native-size-matters`, so you can test yourself how the app will look with and without scaling.   
It is expected to look good on every device you want - iOS or Android, phone or tablet, basically anything (please let me know if not).  
There are also some attached screenshots in the repo if you don't feel like cloning.
