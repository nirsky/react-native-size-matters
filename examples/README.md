# Examples

You can clone the [expo-example-app](./expo-example-app) from this repo.  
After cloning, run `npm install`, then `npm start` and scan the presented QR code in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your preferred device.  

The app has an on/off switch for using `react-native-size-matters`, so you can test yourself how the app will look with and without scaling.   
It is expected to look good on every device you want - iOS or Android, phone or tablet, basically anything (please let me know if isn't).  

There are also some attached [screenshots](./expo-example-app#screenshots) in the repo if you don't feel like cloning.
